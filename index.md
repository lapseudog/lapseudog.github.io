## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/lapseudog/lapseudog.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to **maintain** and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

# Outliers
The Normal distribution is commonly refered in common language.
In addition the Standard deviation is a common measure of the dispersion. While the standard deviation does not only apply to the standard distribution, the standard deviation if often illustrated applied to the standard distribution. Confusing? probably.

## Rule of thumb

## Common method for identifying outliers

### Mean and Standard Deviation

### Median and Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)
Median of the abs[Median - values]

### Median and Interquantile Deviation (IQD)
